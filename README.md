This is Udacity and YH Utbildning Personal blog project.

I used Grid and Flexbox.
When you choose blog from menu you can go to blog.html.
Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
No div or section selectors are without a CSS class or id.
I use 4 css file and import them to main style.css.
Photos are auto change.
